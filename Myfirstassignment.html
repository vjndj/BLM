        What to do during quarantine?
    </h2> </i>
    <p>
        I know quarantine can be really boring and it's very tempting to be lazy, and sit around all day but this is a time to be productive,
        learn new things, and have fun.
        One thing that you can do is read a book. Find a good book thats right for you, sit in a comftorable place and just read. 
        Books can really cure boredom and they can be really interesting to read. Another thing you can do is watch movies or binge tv shows, 
        if you just chill and watch something that you are interested in you will definately have fun. 
        One more thing to do is to build something! Use somethings around your house, literally anything and find a creative way to put them together. 
        This can be super fun and entertaining.

        Quarantine definately hasn't been the best, I have been bored but I always try to find something to do and try to entertain myself.
        One thing that has definately made me happy during this time is listening to music, I made a playlist of all the songs that
        I love and I just like to dance around the house listening to them. I'm also now interested in learning the piano so I have been doing that.
        All in all I've really taken this time to find myself and enjoy my time at home to just relax but to also try new things!
