        <h1>What's Going On In The World Right Now?</h1>
        <p>
            Over the past couple weeks, there have been rallies and protests nationwide, and we as a country have been able to see the
            support within communities of people of all race and background. This movement has been all over social media and most platforms and 
            has raised millions of dollars in funds. These social justice organizations can help poepleby organizing such campains.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are so many confident people who are organizing this! It just takes a group or even just one person to motivated
            advocates who are trying to make a differece in their community.
